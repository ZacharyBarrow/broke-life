Documentation Guide:

```
/*
* This is a test class, and it is awesome.
* Brendan Perry
* 02/11/2020
*/

public class MainClass {
  
  /*
  * It prints out a message.
  * @params: messageToPrint - a string that will be printed
  * @return: 1 - because this method does nothing interesting
  * @author: Brendan Perry
  */
  public int printText(String messageToPrint) {
    if(1 == 1) {
      System.out.println(messageToPrint);
    }
    
    return 1;
  }
}
```

The goal is simple documentation that does not waste too much time but also allows us to stay organized. Listing the author's name will allow us to communicate well when we may need to alter the behavior of a method we did not write.
